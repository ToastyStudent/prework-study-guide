# prework-study-guide

## Description
This project was created by me as part of the Pre-Work for Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp and contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation
This project does not need to be installed, only being a single web page with interactive JavasScript elements in the console.

## Usage
To use this project, review the notes in each section for information about each element used to complete it. Additionally, by opening the [Chrome Web Development Tools] console you can see both a list of said elements as well as a randomized suggestion of which one to study first!

## Credits
I completed this project through the guidance of the various pre-work moduldes produced by Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp.

## License
I used the MIT License for this project.
